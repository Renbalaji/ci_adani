									<p class="text-muted mb-10">The word Competence has been defined by a number of people in varied ways.  Not only is the definition a point of contention amongst various competency theorists, but also as to what constitutes a competency has been hotly debated.</p>
									<p class="text-muted mb-10">
									For the purpose of this program, we shall define competency as a combination of attitude,  skills and knowledge which leads to excellence in performance, or performance which can distinguish between average-performers and superior performers.  The key words here are
									</p>
									<div class="col-lg-9 col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(i)	attitude: it is defined as a combination of traits and behavior: and is representative of the general disposition of the individual to the process of learning and application of knowledge
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(ii) skill: is defined as the practiced ability, or is the demonstrated ability of carrying out a particular role 
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(iii) knowledge: in the context of competency definition it refers to the facts, procedures, and information required to perform a role

									<p class="text-muted mb-10">
									Please note, that often the words competence and competency are used as if they are synonymous.  There is however difference, both from the perspective of the language as well as usage.  From the language perspective  - Competence may be defined as ‘demonstrating the knowledge, skills, experience, and attributes necessary to carry out a defined function effectively.’  While  Competency may be defined as ‘the description of the knowledge, skills, experience and attributes necessary to carry out a defined function effectively.’  And from the usage angle, competent; when used in normal parlance it refers to someone who can ‘just about manage’.  However, the opposite of the word, i.e. incompetent or incompetence, when used, can have large negative implications.

										The competency model for an individual position is normally derived from three different types of competencies; functional, managerial and behavioural.  This is not a fixed rule; based on the model, the managerial and behavioural competencies can be grouped together; leadership competencies can be added as a different cluster.   We shall however be discussing only the managerial and behavioural competencies for this study/program.
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<span class="address-head mb-5">1. Managerial Competencies</span>
											<br>
											These are those competencies (knowledge and skill) which are required for effectively performing a managerial role.  Some of the most commonly required managerial competencies are time management, customer focus, negotiation skills, planning, strategic thinking, leadership etc.  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<span class="address-head mb-5">2. Behavioural Competencies </span>
											<br>
											As mentioned, distinction between a managerial and behavioural competency is quite thin.   As a rough heuristic it can be taken that, when the skill element  of the competency is more significant than the knowledge element of the competency, then we can (assume, without gross error), that the competency is a behavioural competency.  Therefore, it is quite common to see that many models list communication as a behavioural competency.  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<span class="address-head mb-5">3. Functional Competencies</span>
											<br>
											The functional competencies are those set of knowledge and skills that are required for performing a job or a role.  These competencies are usually gained through formal ( and at times professional) education.   For instance, Manpower planning is a functional competency required for a HR professional.  Like wise, Risk Management is a functional competency required for a Manager Risk.   
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											Coming to the next part of the question, the relative importance of each of these competencies (ie managerial, behavioural and functional) is dependent on the position.  The most commonly understood and accepted principle is that, with increasing responsibility (that is upward movement in the organizational hierarchy), the relative importance of functional competencies decreases, while that of the behavioural increases.  It is in fact, this is one of the reasons, that some of the companies take up a separate “level” of competencies to address leadership related issues.

										The process of identifying competencies for an organization is a very important step in the entire process.  To briefly state, every organization has a certain Vision and Mission.  This is usually drawn-up in the context of the present and future business dynamics (the business space in which it operates).  Based on the Vision, certain objectives are set, at the organizational and also the divisional levels (assuming that the organization has multiple divisions).  And for achieving these objectives, organizations draw up, what are known as strategies.  Now, the strategies are further drilled down to functional levels – and these are known as functional strategies.  
									</p>
									<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										Based on the objectives for the organization, the divisional and then the functional objectives are derived.  These are done in such a way that they all dove tail together so as to enable the achievement of the organizational vision and mission.    
									</p>
									<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										The functional objectives, in each of the functions are drilled down further to the individual level, to form what are known as KRA or Key Result Areas.  So an individual who is manning a position would know through his job description of which the Key Result Area is a component, what is expected of him or her.  And, in order for that individual to achieve those KRA’s  he/she would require to posses certain knowledge and skills, or otherwise known as competencies.   A sum total of such competency requirements for various positions in the organization will help one to arrive at the competency basket or the enterprise wide competency requirement.   
									</p>
									<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										But this begs one question to be answered – if the competencies are drawn based on the KRA of various positions (and therefore the immediate needs), how does one take into consideration the future requirements?  The future requirements of the organizations can be got through a group process of the Senior Management Team.  There are also other methods of getting to the future  (and even the present requirements) of competencies; one of which is through Managerial & Behavioural  questionnaire.  This is an instrument which takes an “almost 360 degree” feedback on the competency requirements for various unique positions in the organization; information from which is then collated.

										More than answering the question of how many competencies are required for the mapping and development it will be important to answer the following before finalizing the competency basket
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(a)	Do the identified competencies take care of the need of the business, both from the present as well as future needs?  For example, it may be possible that at present the organization may not have a need for ensuring an elaborate knowledge management process, but this may be necessary at a later date.  Then it would be prudent to include it, subject to other conditions (listed below)
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(b)	Are the identified competencies distinctive enough?  This means that the competencies have to be identified in such a way that there is a clear distinction between those identified.  For instance it may not serve much purpose to have presentation skills and communication skills as two different ones, until and unless there is a real hard case for the same.
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(c)	Do the identified set of competencies cover all the organizational requirements?  As mentioned there are a number of unique positions in the organization and the competency basket identified should ensure that the requirements of all these positions are covered/taken care off. 
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(d)	Does the identified list consists of competencies and not activities?  The definition of a competency, as mentioned earlier is a combination of knowledge and skill; so any identified competency should have both these elements – the degree and extent of each of the components can vary.  So, when identifying a competency it should borne in mind the purpose is eventually to develop that (in an individual), and if the competency so chosen, that this purpose cannot be achieved, then the objective will be defeated.  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(e)	Finally, is the list manageable?  A lot of times, the tendency would be to have a large number of competencies.  But again, it has to be borne in mind that, we have to assess and develop these competencies, and hence a list which is both manageable and tractable should be chosen.
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										It is important that when competency basket is identified these questions are answered by the group.

										Usually, most of the identified competencies, be it managerial or behavioural will be terms/words/phrases which forma part of common management/organizational vocabulary, for eg. communication.    This leads us to a problem, that is, since it is a part of the general diction of the organization, every one thinks they understand the term (eg. Communication), but there will not be a common understanding of the word.  That is, continuing with our example of communication, for some it may mean (excellent ) speaking, for some others it may mean ability to make presentation, and to still others ability to make good reports, etc. Though all of this does constitute communication, it is (a) not all of it, and (ii) it is not the same for every one.  In order to overcome this problem/issue, a Competency Dictionary is prepared.   
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										“A COMPETENCY DICTIONARY IS A ENTERPRISE/ORGANIZATION SPECIFIC DOCUMENT PREPARED IN CONSULTATION WITH ALL KEY CONSTITUENTS WHICH CLEARLY AND LUCIDLY DEFINES AND EXPLAINS, IN TERMS MEANING, OBSERVABLE/DEMONSTRATE SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENTS OF  THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONAL/ MANAGERIAL /BEHAVIOURAL COMPETENCIES IDENTIFIED BY THE ORGANIZATION”
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										A competency dictionary is a document which helps one along all the elements of the Competency Mapping, Assessment and Development Process.  By establishing common definitions, it helps in ensuring that all the constituents have the same understanding of the competency.  Since all the elements are clearly defined, the process of assessment is facilitated, since the aspect of ‘what needs to be assessed’ is well established.  The process of development, is likewise facilitated by the dictionary, as clear issues of what needs to be focused upon by an individual can easily be established.
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										A competency dictionary is not a static document.  One, with changing strategies, new competencies get added to the basket. Two, also with changing conditions, new definitions of existing competencies may have to be drawn-up.

										Positions in the organization structure, depending on nature and volume  are classified as unique and repetitive.  Unique positions, as the name indicates are “one-of-the-kind” positions;  organizations would therefore have positions within the structure such that the total number of people are equal to or greater than the number of unique positions.  To illustrate, there may be one Risk Manager; while there may be three accountants, in an organization, all doing the same job.  So the number of unique positions in this case would be two, while the total number of positions are 4 (three accountants and one manager).  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										Since, the job done by each of the accountants is the same, the organization has, what is known as one unique Job Description*.  For each of these unique positions, the competency required is mapped based on the KRAs.   The mapping of the competencies, for each of the unique positions, is known as Competency Profiling of unique positions.  The following are the steps to be followed for competency profiling  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(a)	Identify all the unique positions in the organization.  If you are in doubt about classifying any position whether it is unique or not, err on the side of unique, ie assume that the position is unique. 
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(b)	For each unique position, identify the level of criticality of the identified competencies.  For the purpose of this study/program we have three levels of criticality
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										<b>Critical</b>:  Are those competencies which are vital for successfully performing the job/role, absence of which (competencies) directly impacts the results.  These are competencies in which a gap, if present, has to be bridged on (top) priority
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										<b>Important</b>:These are those competencies which are necessary for carrying out the job; but may not directly impact immediate performance.  Gaps should be bridged
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										<b>Less Important</b>: These are those competencies which may not directly impact the performance of the job, but the knowledge of which could be beneficial – it can be viewed as a Add on Competency.  Gaps can be bridged based on the organizational need
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(c)	Having identified the level of criticality, next the level of proficiency has to be determined.  It has to be noted that the level of criticality to proficiency is NOT a one-to-one relationship,  which means that for an unique position, a given competency may be Critical, but the level of proficiency may be Practitioner; whereas for another position the competency may be critical and the level of requirement (proficiency) may be Developed.  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										It is preferable to profile positions in a group.   The group should preferably consists of some senior member along with HR team (apart from the members of that department/function)  to ensure that the process is carried out objectively.

Having identified what competencies are required at what level of proficiency (the information that is captured in the Competency Profile), it becomes necessary map the individual (the present incumbent) with respect to the job profile.  Depending on what competencies are identified, the assessment process – the instruments used, the tools and techniques employed and the methodology followed, would vary.

										In the process of competency assessment, one of the important steps is the preparation of the Assessment Report.  Once the assessment process is completed, the individual will have to be provided with a feedback on the assessment.  This feedback is usually in the form of a written report (in some extreme cases, if agreed upon initially/or at the start of the process, it can be in a oral form).  This feedback report, known as the Competency Assessment Report, usually contains the following 
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(a)	a brief summary of the assessment result of each of the identified competency.  This form of presentation is what many organizations do, while some may take a composite approach method that is giving overall summary.  However, in order to derive maximum benefit out of the process, it is necessary to present results corresponding to each of the competency.  Depending on the scale used, appropriate adjectives are used to describe the individuals ‘demonstrated capability’ on each of the competency 
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(b)	profile and assessed results:  the competency profile describes the requirement of the position and after the assessment, it is necessary to present the results with reference to the positional requirements.  This is done, since not all the competencies will be important for a position, and hence viewing gaps or strengths has to be done vis-à-vis the requirements of the position (and not  in isolation )
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(c)	  significant strengths and development areas:  as mentioned, multiple instruments/methods are used in the assessment process, and therefore it is relatively easy to identify as to what are an individuals significant strengths (reflected often through the instrument/method) and development areas.
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(d)	Vectorized values:  this is a technique where in numbers are used to quantify the requirements of a job and like-wise the assessed results of the individual; and this is done by assigning appropriate values to the levels of proficiency and criticality of each competency.  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										Apart from the above, depending on the need of the organization, other information, such as behavioural profile, tests results, case analysis etc. can be included.

										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(a)	Manpower Planning:  The term people requirement in an organization is actually a misnomer.  What an organization wants is a certain set of skills and capabilities; stated otherwise organizational manpower requirement is synonymous with Organization Competency Requirements.  Hence, the competency information can be used for the process of manpower planning
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(b)	Recruitment:  One of the areas  where competency related information can be used is in the process of recruitment.  Since, competency by definition is a combination of knowledge and skills, usage of competency profiles for the selection process enables in identifying the exact requirement of the organization (that is, it helps in preparing the job specification template).  This information in turn helps in selecting the “right fit” .
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(c)	Learning & Development:  Most organization use the Competency process for drawing-up individual (as well as group) development road maps.  As opposed to the conventionally followed approach to the training and development need identification process, this methodology helps in drawing-up a more focused and (individually) meaningful development processes.  This learning and development road maps include all the information for individual development
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(d)	Performance Management System: The Competency process can also be used in the performance management system.  The incorporation of the competency process as a part of the PMS would depend on a number of organization related issues, which include level of acceptance, the maturity of the system, the synergy with the existing PMS etc.  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
										(e)	Career & Succession Planning:  Since the competency profiling sheets has all the required information for the various unique positions in the organization, it becomes easy for an organization to identify where the present set of incumbents are (post assessment) and where they may “best fit in”.  
										</p>

											 Profiling of positions helps the organization in many ways 
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											(a)	Not all competencies, as mentioned, are important for a job, to the same degree.  The process of profiling will help in focusing of energies by the organization and also the individual manning the position, on those areas which make a significant impact on the performance. 
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											(b)	The organization, can use the information from the competency profile for succession planning, i.e. it will make the process of identifying, among the various reporting positions, a suitable reporting position which can eventually be ‘moved-up’.  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											(c)	Apart from this, the competency profiling process helps, in areas such as in recruitment and training.

											Competency profiling is usually a group process; and consists of people belonging to that particular function/department are area and representatives from HR, along with facilitating/consulting agency (based on need/organization requirement).  The people from the function are so chosen that there is at least one representative person for each of the unique positions identified (at times it may be convenient to have more than one person representing a unique position).   
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											Once the group has been formed (and assembled) the following are the steps that are followed  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											(a)	Reconfirmation of the unique positions in the department.  If in doubt about classifying any position whether it is unique or not, err on the side of unique, ie assume that the position is unique. 
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											(b)	For each unique position, identify the level of criticality of the identified competencies.  For the purpose of this study/program we have three levels of criticality
											<p class="text-muted mb-10">
												<b>Critical:</b>  Are those competencies which are vital for successfully performing the job/role, absence of which (competencies) directly impacts the results.  These are competencies in which a gap, if present, has to be bridged on (top) priority
											</p>
											<p class="text-muted mb-10">
												<b>Important :</b> These are those competencies which are necessary for carrying out the job; but may not directly impact immediate performance.  Gaps should be bridged
											</p>
											<p class="text-muted mb-10">
												<b>Less Important :</b> These are those competencies which may not directly impact the performance of the job, but the knowledge of which could be beneficial – it can be viewed as a Add on Competency.  Gaps can be bridged based on the organizational need
											</p>
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											(c)	Having identified the level of criticality, next the level of proficiency has to be determined.  It has to be noted that the level of criticality to proficiency is NOT a one-to-one relationship,  which means that for an unique position, a given competency may be Critical, but the level of proficiency may be Practitioner; whereas for another position the competency may be critical and the level of requirement (proficiency) may be Developed.  
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											After completion  of the profiling for a entire department/function, prepare a composite statement of the profile information of the various unique positions.  This will help in establishing a quick reference of requirements, in a given department or function.

										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<b><u>Issue</u><b><br>
											The information in the JD is not very clear to enable the process of profiling.The, information in a job description is usually in a nartive/descriptive form and the only 	quantitative data (relevant to profiling)  that is available is in the form of KRAs. When looking/analysing a JD, one should pay careful attention to the key aspects that are 			expected to be performed by that job-holder. In case, even after careful scrutiny the profiling related information cannot be culled, then information from other inputs, such as Managerial and Behavioural sheets should be used.Apart from this,the issue can partly be addressed by doing it in a group. 
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<b><u>Issues </u><b><br>
											The JD is not available
											Profiling can be done, only on the availability of a JD.In case no formal JD is available, have a draft form of it atleast prepared, before commencing the profiling process.

										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<b><u>Issue  </u><b><br>
											There is no agreement, between the incumbent, his boss, and HR on the level of criticality and level of proficiency for a particular position.The disagreement usually comes because of a generally tendency for any incumbent to look at the requirements for the position he/she is manning, to be much higher than what may be required.  This comes from two reasons, one a person wanting to know that his/her job requirements are very stringent/high and two, because of some kind of a comparison, with an equivalent job elsewhere in the organization. In rare instances, it may also be possible, that an incumbent would like to look at his/her job, as needing a “lesser” than required level of competencies.Irrespective of the difference (wanting it be high or low), the way to overcome the problem, is make an objective evaluation, using JD information, description of the competency as given in the dictionary, Managerial & behavioural Attribute Sheet,and the group opinion.

										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<b><u>Issue   </u><b><br>
											There is a difficulty in identifying the assessment tools/techniques Before identifying the techniques, it would be necessary to determine the amount of time that the organization will be spending in the process of assessment.  If the number of people to be assessed are quite large it will not be possible to deploy a very intensive approach (For example, if the total number of people to be assessed are say 600, then using a method which takes about 2-3days for assessment, would mean a total of 1200-1800 man-days for this process, which the organization will have to ear-mark!)  Once the size of the group to be assessed and the probable time allocated are determined, then the process of identifying the method/tools/techniques to be deployed can be started.  When identifying the tools and techniques, the first and foremost rule would be to ensure that for each of the identified competencies, we can get more than one (i.e. multiple) opportunity for assessing the person on that competency.  Simply put, if a matrix of competencies and the techniques is prepared, as shown below, the most densely populated matrix would be the most effective one.

											<b><u>Issue   </u><b>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">It seems to be difficult to establish a exact fit – between the competency to be assessed and the method to be used  </p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											One of the ways of addressing this problem is to identify the competencies which may have a significant (relatively speaking) knowledge element, an example of this kind could be strategic thinking.  For these kinds of competencies, it is preferable to use case/caselet, interview or discussion methods.   There are certain competencies, which have a significant skill/behavioral element,  such as emotional stability.   For such competencies, a behavioral instrument may be a ideal method for assessment.   For those competencies which have a combination of a knowledge and skill/behavioral component, it is preferable to use combinatorial approach – ie cases, discussions etc and also behavioral. 
											</p>
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<b><u>Issue   </u><b>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">There are certain competencies, where an ideal instrument or a technique is not available </p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											At times, certain competencies may be included in the basket,  where to identify an exact method may be difficult.  In such cases, it should be ensured during the process of assessment, that either through the process of discussion or interviewing, the person is particularly probed on issues/elements relating to this competency.  Apart from this, using techniques such as 360 degree feedback will help in the process of assessment.  
											</p>
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<b><u>Issue   </u><b>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">The appropriate case study doesn’t seem to be available</p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											Usually for most of the identified competencies, case studies are available (ideal sources are Harvard , Thunderbird , ICFAI , and  the European Case Clearing House ). There are certain points that have to be borne in mind in choosing a case 
											</p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											(i)	does the central theme of the case relate to the competency being assessed
											</p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											(ii)	 depending on the time availability, the group being assessed and the competencies that are to be evaluated, a case of appropriate size/length should be chosen
											</p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											(iii)	preferably the case settings should not be too dis-similar to the ones with which the assessee can relate to. 
											</p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											In choosing the case, for the process of assessment it is essential to remember that it is not only the case that is important, but more important are the questions that are to be framed.  If in case, a appropriate case is not found, then a case has to be developed, by the group, taking the help of external facilitators.  
											</p>
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<b><u>Issue   </u><b>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											There is a degree of subjectivity in the process of assessment, especially when it comes to the cases
											</p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											Through out the process of assessment, there is bound to be a certain amount of subjectivity, more so when evaluating cases.  With regards cases, on framing questions, it may be beneficial to prepare a set of points which you feel the presented has to include as a part of his analysis.  Apart from this, juxtaposing the results of the case along with information from other cases can also help in the process of getting a composite picture.  
											</p>
										</p>
										<p class="text-muted mb-10">
											<b><u>Issue   </u><b>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											Two of the instruments are throwing up conflicting results 
											</p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											Most of the times, such a situation does not happen, provided the instruments and methods chosen have been done so with great care.  Even in the extreme event that this happens, one may use the following to resolve the issue
											</p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											(i)	see for the trend, on that particular competency, by collating information from all the administered instruments and cases.  Usually this should give some kind of indication of the persons competency in that area.  
											</p>
											<p  class="text-muted mb-10">
											(ii)	In the unlikely event that one does not still get a trend, then use information from instruments such as peer group review or 360 degree feedback.
