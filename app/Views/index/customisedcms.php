<p><b><u>Organizations</u></b>: Have you rolled out an Assessment and Development center, in the past? And are you faced with the following issues </p>
<ul>
	<li>Who are the employees who have been assessed?</li>
	<li>What were the assessment methods used for each band of employees?</li>
	<li>Who were the assessors and what was their feedback on the process?</li>
	<li>How can I access all the individual reports at one place?</li>
	<li>How can I monitor the individual development road-maps?</li>
	<li>What initiatives have been taken in the process of development, and what has been their progress?</li>
	<li>I had done an assessment before this, how do I now do a comparison of the results?</li>
	<li>Can I have decision enabling dashboards from the assessment process?</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of organizations do roll out assessment centers typically most (or all of it) done as an off-line process, and because of that they are faced with the above (and many more related) issues. We work with organizations to e-Enable their Competency Processes by customizing our N-Compas, and helping them gain the maximum leverage from their CADC. </p>
