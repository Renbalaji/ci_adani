					<p class="content">"Ashok, this is Yugander (the production incharge in the night shift), good evening. There is small issue. As you know the SOP for Alpha 564 (coded) says that we should do inertization with N2, but for the past many months we have never done that, because of production pressure. There was lightening safety audit just now and they have found this deviation. They are telling they will tell plant manager and have the line shut down tomorrow"
						"Could you please let us know if there is a deviation note that you can issue for us, stating that it is OK. As you know, nothing has happened in the past"

						"But isn’t there some H2S production in the process."

						"Well very small quantity,"

						"Ok, let me check tomorrow morning with process and also my boss. I don’t want to commit anything"

						"But boss, kuch karo, we are in trouble. The production meeting at 9:00, we don’t want to get scolded in that…"

						It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

						There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
